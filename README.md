 test execution with simple string commands

5p 17s 8d + 3p 4s 10d = 9p 2s 6d

9p 2s 6d - 5p 17s 8d = 3p 4s 10d

5p 17s 8d * 2 = 11p 15s 4d

5p 17s 8d / 3 = 1p 19s 2d (2d)

18p 16s 1d / 15 = 1p 5s 0d (1s 1d)

 test execution with combined commands of the class

5p 17s 8d  + 3p 4s 10d  = 9p 2s 6d

5p 17s 8d  + 3p 4s 10d  - 5p 17s 8d  = 0p 0s 0d

(5p 17s 8d  + 3p 4s 10d ) *2 = 18p 5s 0d

((5p 17s 8d  + 3p 4s 10d ) *2)/7 = 2p 12s 1d (5d)
